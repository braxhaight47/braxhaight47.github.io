        <h2>Peer Review 1</h2>
        <p>1. Does the submission lead to the right page?</p>
        <p>Yes the submission is a direct link to the client project home page.</p>
        <p>2. No upper cases or spaces in file/folder names?</p>
        <p>File is correctly named.</p>
        <p>3. Design: CRAP (Contrast, Repitition, Alignment, Proximity)?</p>
        <p>
            C: The contrast of the words and the background color work well to make the site easy to read.<br>
            R: The header is consistant and the structure of each page is the same.<br>
            A: Pictures should be aligned with the words better for better readability.<br>
            P: The dark sky map is in an odd proximity to the center, but the rest of the site distances pictues well.<br>
        <p>4. Page has header, main, footer, nav (optional)?</p>
        <p>Page has all neccessary components.</p>
        <p>5. Header has site/brand and h1 with relavent name?</p>
        <p>Header has appropriete labels and information.</p>
        <p>6. Main starts with name of the page and h2 does not have site/brand?</p>
        <p>The h2 explains the site with name and information.</p>
        <p>7. Page has brand tagline somewhere?</p>
        <p>The brand is in the footer</p>
        <p>8. Page has footer with menu for user pages, html and css validation?</p>
        <p>Yes, all are there.</p>
        <p>9. Page meets the specific requirements?</p>
        <p>From what I can tell, the site does not meet the ajax, jquery or jquery ui requirements and seems to lack substantial explaiantions on some pages such as the dark sky map has zero clarifying information.</p>
