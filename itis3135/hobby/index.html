                Green has a large amount of titans and animals, the majority being focused on gaining mana advantage then playing large creatures. <br><br>
                Titans primarily focus on trampling over all forces your oppenets try and put in your way.<br><br>
                Animals tend to be used to gain mana advantage in order to prepare for the large creatures.<br><br>
                Elves focus on creating large amounts of card draw and mana advantage.<br><br>
                These creatures are the core of green and if they sound like your thing then green is for you!<br><br>
