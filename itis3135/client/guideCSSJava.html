            <h2>Learn to Use JavaScript</h2>
             <p>Welcome to our website that teaches people how to use JavaScript! JavaScript is a popular programming language that is widely used to create interactive websites and applications.</p>
             <h2>Getting Started</h2>
             <p>To get started with JavaScript, you will need a text editor to write your code. There are many options available, both free and paid, such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Sublime Text. You will also need a web browser to run your JavaScript code.</p>
             <h2>Your First JavaScript Program</h2>
             <p>Once you have your text editor and web browser set up, you can start writing your first JavaScript code. To do this, create a new file using your text editor and save it with the .js file extension. Then, you can start writing your code in the file.</p>
             <p>JavaScript uses a syntax similar to other programming languages, with variables, data types, operators, and control structures. For example, here is a simple JavaScript program that prints "Hello, world!" to the console:</p>
             <pre>
             // This is a single-line comment

             /* This is a
             multi-line comment */

             // Declare a variable called message
             var message = "Hello, world!";

             // Print the value of the message variable to the console
             console.log(message);
             </pre>
             <p>In the code above, we first define a variable called `message` and assign it the string value "Hello, world!". Then, we use the `console.log` function to print the value of the `message` variable to the console.</p>
             <p>To run this code, you can save it in a file and then open the file in your web browser. The output of the code will be displayed in the browser's developer tools console.</p>
             <h2>Next Steps</h2>
             <p>There are many more features and capabilities of JavaScript, such as working with arrays, objects, and functions. You can learn more about these concepts and how to use them in your code by exploring the tutorials and examples on our website.</p>
             <p>We also have a separate styles.css file that defines the styles for our website, such as font sizes and colors. You can use CSS to customize the appearance of your website and make it more visually appealing.</p>
             <p>In addition, we have a separate script.js file that contains JavaScript code to add interactivity to our website. For example, you can use JavaScript to create animations, handle user input, and make web pages dynamic.</p>
             <p>We hope this website helps you learn how to use JavaScript to create interactive and engaging websites and applications. Happy coding!</p>
