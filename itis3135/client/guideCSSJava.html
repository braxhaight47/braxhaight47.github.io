            <p>This tutorial will walk through how to do the CSS and Javascript for the website started on the previous tutorial (<a href="guideHTML.html">Previous Tutorial</a>).</p>
            <p>This portion can either be added in as internal style/script or using an external style/scirpt page, however if using the creative tab it is important to note it must be done internally.</p>

            <h2>CSS Tutorial</h2>
              <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.</p>
              <h2>How do I use CSS?</h2>
              <p>To use CSS, you need to create a stylesheet and link it to your HTML file. You can do this by adding a `&lt;link&gt;` element in the `&lt;head&gt;` of your HTML file, with the `href` attribute set to the URL of your stylesheet file:</p>
              <pre>
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
              </pre>
              <p>The other way to do CSS is by using internal style tags at the top of your document. This can be done by placing style tags in the head tag.</p>
              <pre>
                &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;style&gt;
                    "content"
                &lt;/style&gt;
                &lt;/head&gt;
              </pre>
              <p>Once you have linked your stylesheet to your HTML file, you can add CSS rules to it to style your HTML elements. A CSS rule has two parts: a selector, which specifies the HTML element(s) to be styled, and a declaration block, which contains one or more declarations that specify the styles to be applied to the selected element(s). Each declaration consists of a property and a value, separated by a colon:</p>
              <pre>
                selector {
                  property: value;
                  property: value;
                }
            </pre>
            <p>Another important portion of CSS is the ability to create classes or ids to target groups or individual elements. Essentially there is a way to create targeted rules, the first of which is classes. Classes will apply to a group of elements with the same class meaning they are ideal if there are multiple elements that need to share similar properities. On the other hand, ids are only able to be used for one element and therefore target a single specific element.</p>
            <p>To create a class, the dot selector is used as shown below.</p>
            <pre>
              .class_name {
                property: value;
                property: value;
              }
            </pre>
            <p>To create an id, the # selector is used as shown below.</p>
            <pre>
              #id_name {
                property: value;
                property: value;
              }
            </pre>
            <p>To apply these to the desired elements, the class or id must be declared in the HTML portion as shown below.</p>
            <pre>
                &lt;element class="class_name" id="id_name"&gt;&lt;/element&gt;
            </pre>
              <h2>Examples</h2>
              <p>Here are some examples of CSS rules that you can use to style your HTML elements for the webiste from the HTML tutorial:</p>
              <pre>
                  &lt;style&gt;
                      h1 {text-align: center;
                       color: #301934;
                      }
                      li {
                       color: #301934;
                      }
                      ol {
                       color: #301934;
                      }
                      p {color: #301934;}
                      .colorBackground {
                      background-color: #CBC3E3;
                      padding: 5px;
                      }
                  &lt;/style&gt;
            </pre>
            <p>The element styles will change the color and format of the elements themselves for the entire website, and the colorBackground class can be applied to the div element to give the entire 'website' a different background color.</p>
            <h2>Learn to Use JavaScript</h2>
             <p>Welcome to our website that teaches people how to use JavaScript! JavaScript is a popular programming language that is widely used to create interactive websites and applications.</p>
             <h2>Getting Started</h2>
             <p>To get started with JavaScript, you will need a text editor to write your code. There are many options available, both free and paid, such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Sublime Text. You will also need a web browser to run your JavaScript code.</p>
             <h2>Your First JavaScript Program</h2>
             <p>Once you have your text editor and web browser set up, you can start writing your first JavaScript code. To do this, create a new file using your text editor and save it with the .js file extension. Then, you can start writing your code in the file.</p>
             <p>JavaScript uses a syntax similar to other programming languages, with variables, data types, operators, and control structures. For example, here is a simple JavaScript program that prints "Hello, world!" to the console:</p>
             <pre>
             // This is a single-line comment

             /* This is a
             multi-line comment */

             // Declare a variable called message
             var message = "Hello, world!";

             // Print the value of the message variable to the console
             console.log(message);
             </pre>
             <p>In the code above, we first define a variable called `message` and assign it the string value "Hello, world!". Then, we use the `console.log` function to print the value of the `message` variable to the console.</p>
             <p>To run this code, you can save it in a file and then open the file in your web browser. The output of the code will be displayed in the browser's developer tools console.</p>
             <h2>Next Steps</h2>
             <p>There are many more features and capabilities of JavaScript, such as working with arrays, objects, and functions. You can learn more about these concepts and how to use them in your code by exploring the tutorials and examples on our website.</p>
             <p>We also have a separate styles.css file that defines the styles for our website, such as font sizes and colors. You can use CSS to customize the appearance of your website and make it more visually appealing.</p>
             <p>In addition, we have a separate script.js file that contains JavaScript code to add interactivity to our website. For example, you can use JavaScript to create animations, handle user input, and make web pages dynamic.</p>
             <p>We hope this website helps you learn how to use JavaScript to create interactive and engaging websites and applications. Happy coding!</p>
