            HTML is comprised of 'tags' which look like this &lt;&gt; and add parts to the website.<br>
            For every opening tag there is a closing tag that looks like this &lt;/&gt;<br>
            By combining these tags and putting in content, you can create a webpage!<br>
            The following is the set up of a page, and is preset for the creative page so there is no need to type it.<br>
            <br>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;- Sets the type of the page to HTML as it is a HTML file.<br>
            &lt;html lang="en"&gt;- Sets the default language to english.<br>
            &lt;head&gt;- This is the head tag, used for setting the title and linking style sheets.<br>
            &lt;title&gt;- This creates the title of the page, or what is written in the websites tab.<br>

            &lt;/title&gt;- This is a closing tag for title<br>
            &lt;/head&gt;- This is a closing tag for head<br>
            &lt;body&gt;- This is a body tag, all the main parts of the website are placed here.<br>
            <br>
            This is all the preloaded code that establishes the body of the HTML for this and the creative page.<br>
            <br>
            Step 1: &lt;h2&gt;Why we love hippos&lt;/h2&gt;<br>
            This is a header and the 2 in h2 specifies the size, they go from 1-7 with 1 being the heading of the page.<br>
            <br>
            Step 2: &lt;p&gt;Hippos are found in Africa and can swim up to 25mph!&lt;/p&gt;<br>
            This is a text block that allows chunks of text to be added such as this very sentence!<br>
            <br>
            Step 3: &lt;a href="https://www.natgeokids.com/uk/discover/animals/general-animals/ten-hippo-facts/"&gt; For some extra hippo facts click this link!!&lt;/a&gt;<br>
            This is an anchor tag will allow you to link other websites or pages to the anchor tag by placing the link in quotes.<br>
            <br>
            Step 4:
            &lt;h3&gt;Types of Hippos&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Common Hippo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pygmy Hippo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;<br>
            This is an unordered list tag that lets you make list elements and put them in a bulleted list for displaying information.<br>
            <br>
            This is the closing of the preset tags in the beggining of the HTML from the beggining of the website.<br>
            &lt;/body&gt;- This is the closing body tag.<br>
            &lt;/html&gt;- This is the closing of the html tag and end of the website!<br>
