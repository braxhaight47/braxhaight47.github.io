                <p>
                    The website starts off with products organized in a pretty patern on the front page to grap attention, along with a search bar at the top.
                    The layout colors are purple and white and make sure to keep all peices distinct and easy to read.
                    When a sub menu is clicked it opens a drop down on the right that draws attention to it and is easy to read.
                    Given that the goal of the website is to draw your attention to furniture and provide easy access to more information regarding said furniture,
                    the easy to read layout and the easy to see peices of furniture right on the websites home page live up to their goal.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This webiste lives up to these principals as the constrast between purple and white makes all the words easy to read,
                    but does not draw attention away from their products nor does it make their products hard to see. Repitition is seen as
                    all pages have the same menu bar, and all items have a similar screen depicting more details. Alignemnt plays a large role
                    in helping distinguish all parts of the website from eachother to make sure they can all be seen, but do not overcrowd the screen
                    Proximity is huge here as they have created an optimal amount of furniture to show to attempt to draw you in without overcrowding
                    the screen, and they have all tabs close enough to see them all, but far away enough to distinguish them.
