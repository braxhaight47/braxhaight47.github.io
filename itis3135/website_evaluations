            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.wayfair.com/">Wayfair</a></h3>
                <p>
                    The website starts off with products organized in a pretty patern on the front page to grap attention, along with a search bar at the top.
                    The layout colors are purple and white and make sure to keep all peices distinct and easy to read.
                    When a sub menu is clicked it opens a drop down on the right that draws attention to it and is easy to read.
                    Given that the goal of the website is to draw your attention to furniture and provide easy access to more information regarding said furniture,
                    the easy to read layout and the easy to see peices of furniture right on the websites home page live up to their goal.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C: Contrast</li>
                    <li>R: Repitition</li>
                    <li>A: Alignment</li>
                    <li>P: Proximity</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This webiste lives up to these principals as the constrast between purple and white makes all the words easy to read,
                    but does not draw attention away from their products nor does it make their products hard to see. Repitition is seen as
                    all pages have the same menu bar, and all items have a similar screen depicting more details. Alignemnt plays a large role
                    in helping distinguish all parts of the website from eachother to make sure they can all be seen, but do not overcrowd the screen
                    Proximity is huge here as they have created an optimal amount of furniture to show to attempt to draw you in without overcrowding
                    the screen, and they have all tabs close enough to see them all, but far away enough to distinguish them.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://arngren.net/">Arngren</a></h3>
                <p>
                    The website starts off with products organized in no particular order to try and force your attention,but the disorganization makes it impossible to understand the options.
                    The layout is varying across each line and all the colors clash with no clear order to the chaos.
                    All item description screens vary so it is disorienting to travel between them.
                    Given that the goal of the website is to draw your attention to items and provide easy access to more information regarding said items,
                    the incomprehensible layout makes their goal fail and makes the website impossible to look at for too long.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C: Contrast</li>
                    <li>R: Repitition</li>
                    <li>A: Alignment</li>
                    <li>P: Proximity</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This webiste does not live up to these principals as the constrast between varying colors of dozens of objects draws attention from one
                    to the next leaving no time to actually look at one. Repitition is not featured here as each image is of varying
                    color and placement, along with varying item description screens disorient the reader. Alignemnt plays a large role
                    in helping distinguish all parts of the website from eachother, but this website overcrowds the screen and makes reading an impossible task.
                    Proximity is huge here as they have clumped all the objects together in a small space making distinguishing them difficult.
