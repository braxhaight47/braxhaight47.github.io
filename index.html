        <h3>Professional Background</h3>
        <p>I have worked jobs at Harris Teeter and Preston Wood Country Club, but my most recent job was as an IT Software Development

        <h3>Academic Background</h3>
        <p>I went to Apex Friendship High School, where I then went to NC State for my freshman year before transferring here to
