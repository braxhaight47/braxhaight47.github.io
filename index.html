        <h3>Personal Background</h3>
        <p>I moved to North Carolina from northern Virginia before my freshman year of high school and have lived in Raleigh since.
        <br> I have always been invested in computer science since early high school and hope to pursue that while here at UNCC!
        </p>
        <h3>Professional Background</h3>
        <p>I have worked jobs at Harris Teeter and Preston Wood Country Club, but my most recent job was as an IT Software Development
        <br> intern for Centene desiging scripts for thier IT department and an application for them to utilize the scripts day to day.
        </p>
        <h3>Academic Background</h3>
        <p>I went to Apex Friendship High School, where I then went to NC State for my freshman year before transferring here to
        <br>UNCC last year for my final two years of undergrad and hopefully my year of graduate school to get my masters here as well.
